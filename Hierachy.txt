Under the new constitution, a new hierachy is to follow. 



Court35 demands that it has its own role and shall be entitled to the highest possible powers, with executive jurisdiction and overriding capabilities on all domains.
This is final. 


A royal approval is to be declared for the "formala" hierachy which is the official hierachy with actual jurisdiction on this constitution. Other private, sub-forms are
secondary and are to extend with no overriding features.



His Majesty,
Court35.
